\section*{Abstract}
In-degree control in P2P networks has longed been known to be a problem, but
current solutions are less than satisfactory.  We contribute two useful
techniques to help design future structured and unstructured P2P topologies: an
analysis using ergodic Markov-chains which shows the effects of variable
in-degree, and second, a set of random walk driven transformations to control
in-degree in both structured and unstructured topologies.  Both contributions
are analyzed via simulation.

\section{Ergodic Topology Analysis}

Ergodic theory has been widely used in the long-term analysis of complex
systems in physics and economics, but has seemingly slipped under the radar of
the P2P research community.  We first offer a quick primer of ergodic
Markov-models, and then discuss their application to P2P topologies.  Finally,
we give show an example using a P2P topology we have been developing. 

\subsection{Ergodic Markov-chains}

We define a Markov-chain as a set of states, $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$.  A
Markov-process moves discreetly from state to state as the process
progresses.  Such Markov-processes use a matrix $\textbf{P}$, the transition
matrix, to decide which state to enter next.  Each element $p_{ij}$ in
$\textbf{P}$ defines the probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$.

In an ergodic Markov-chain (EMC) it must be possible to go from every state to every
state, including the same state, as a Markov-process runs to time $n \rightarrow
\infty$.  Note that this transition does not have to
happen in a single step of the Markov-process, and that every state does not
need to be reachable during each step.  Such chains are periodic, and are
called irregular.  Any absorbing Markov-chain, where
there is an absorbing state $s_i$ such that $\sum_{j, j \ne i}{p_{ij}} = 0$, is
also irregular.  While still ergodic, irregular chains are more difficult to
analyze.  However, all P2P topologies we have encountered are regular, so we do
not consider irregular chains further in this work.
%It would be nice to show that this holds with high probability

%No matter, the techniques below should be extendible to such non-regular
%chains.
Whereas the probability to be in state $s_j$ after a single step in the
Markov-process is given by $s_i$, the current state, and the probability of
transition $p_{ij}$, the probability to be in $s_j$ after two steps if given by
$p_{ij}^{(2)}$:

\begin{equation}
	p_{ij}^{(2)} = \sum_{k}{p_{ik}p_{kj}}
\end{equation}

For example, if there is a Markov-chain where $|S| = 3$, the probability of
transitioning from $s_1$ to $s_3$ in two steps is:

\begin{equation}
	p_{13}^{(2)} = p_{11}p_{13} + p_{12}p_{23} + p_{13}p_{33}
\end{equation}

This is the same as taking element $p_{13}^{(2)}$ in the matrix
$\textbf{P}^2$.  In general, $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ is found in a regular ergodic
Markov-model by calculating $\textbf{P}^n$ and taking the value at the i-th
row, j-th column.

As $n \rightarrow \infty$, $\textbf{P}^{n+1} \rightarrow \textbf{P}^n$, or in
other words, the matrix converges to a steady state.  This limiting matrix,
called $\textbf{W}$, contains the stationary distribution $\textbf{w}$, a row
vector which is repeated for each row in $\textbf{W}$.  We do not offer
a full proof for convergence here,
%See [Aldous and Fill], [Lovasz], or [Grinstead and Snell]
but instead offer the following intuition: at each multiplication of
$\textbf{P}^n$ with $\textbf{P}$, the values in $\textbf{P}^{n+1}$ are averages
of the components in $\textbf{P}^n$.  In particular, each component in a column
vector of $\textbf{P}^n$ is averaged with its fellow components, until they
eventually converge to a single value, $\textbf{w}_i$ for column $i$.
The stationary distribution $w$ in turn gives the probability in to be in
state $s_i$ after a perfectly mixed random walk across the Markov model.

\subsection{Application of EMCs for P2P}
\label{sec:ergodic-application}

We can easily apply ergodic Markov-chains two numerically solve for two
interesting properties of unstructured search: the probability of reaching any
given node after a walk of length $n$, and the necessary length of a random
walk for it to be fully ``mixed'' into the network.  After a brief discussion on
transforming P2P topologies into Markov-models, we review each result in turn.

\subsubsection{Deriving the Markov-chain}

There are two elements to consider when modeling unstructured networks using
Markov-models: the \emph{structure of the topology} and \emph{the random walk
process}.  Structure can be defined in a number of ways in different systems,
but is usually thought of as a graph $G = (V, E)$ resulting from local decision
rules.  The local rules can often be further modeled as a link probability
function, $q(i,j)$, which gives the probability that nodes $i$ and $j$ are
connected.  The random walk process is also modeled as a set of local rules,
used to decide the next hop of the walk.  Typically these rules consists no
more than a probability distribution that assigns a probability to take each
link at the current node.

The easiest case in which to the transition probability matrix $P$ describing
the Markov-chain assumes a directed graph and an unbiased random walk.
Given an existing topology and these assumptions , we can easily find the
elements of $\textbf{P}$ given $d_{out}(i)$, the out degree of node $i$:

\begin{equation}
	p_{ij} = \begin{cases}
							1 / d_{out}(i) & \text{if $ij \in E$,}\\
							0              & \text{otherwise.}
					 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
% Directed formulation of version from [Lovasz].  Needs a cite?

Similar transformations are easy to derive for other random walk processes.
Extending the technique further, we can also analyze the entire set of
topologies defined by $q(i,j)$ at once.  Given a constant out-degree $d_{out}$,
and a set of nodes $V$, we define the elements of $\textbf{P}$ as:

\begin{equation}
	p_{ij} = q(i,j) / d_{out}
\end{equation}

Note, we no longer need the edge set $E$.  Instead, we are now looking at
properties across \emph{all} topologies defined by $q(i,j)$ and a given set of
nodes.

\subsubsection{Converging the Markov-chain}

Once $\textbf{P}$ is derived, it is simple to find $\textbf{P}^n$ by either
brute computation or single-value decomposition of the first left-eigenvalue.
Blah blah on how$\ldots$

Once $\textbf{w}$ is found in $n$ steps, we can characterize the fitness of a
given topology (or set of topologies) for random walks.  The simplest way to do
this is to assume $\textbf{w}$ has a Gaussian distribution and
calculate the standard deviation.  What exactly this number means depends on
the P2P network, so we now walk through a typical example.

Imagine a file sharing network, such as Gnutella, where data is statically
placed on the originating node.  Assume, for the moment, that such data is
uniformly distributed across the network.  For a single random walk to
efficiently find a piece of desired data, it needs to visit the greatest number
of nodes possible during it's limited number of hops.  Clearly, if some nodes
have a higher change to be visited, they will be visited more often during the
walk, possibly in place of nodes that actually contain the data.  The higher
the standard deviation of $\textbf{w}$, the worse a single walk will perform.
Multiple walks only make this more apparent.  Assuming the walks are
uncorrelated, each walk now has a greater change to visit the \emph{same nodes}
which are reached with greater probability, a waste of resource.

The problem remains even if one assumes a more realistic distribution of data,
such as Zipf.  Unless the nodes with greater reachability probability also
happen to contain an equal proportion of the data, the network is still
inefficient.  And all this assumes a uniform request rate, something that
is long-tailed in currently deployed networks.

Next, the speed at which $\textbf{P}$ converges to $\textbf{W}$ gives the
mixing length.  The mixing length describes how long a random walk must be
before being uncorrelated with the starting location, or in other words, is ina
truly random location in the network.  The longer a walk stays correlated with
the starting node $i$, the longer it is likely to be visiting nodes in the
neighborhood of $i$.

% Wayyyyy more here, but need to move on tonight...


\subsubsection{A real world application}

Our own exploration of ergodic theory, and ergodic Markov-models in particular,
came about when we noticed our own P2P topology, Spinneret, showed serious
in-degree imbalance.  Spinneret is designed to support both structured and
unstructured search techniques on a single topology, so we were alarmed to see
over an order of magnitude difference between nodes in-degree.  The initial
concern was that poorly balanced in-degree would lead to higher bandwidth usage
for some nodes, creating natural bottlenecks for both greedy and unstructured
search.  However, as we will now show, the analyzing the topology as an ergodic
Markov-model revealed much a much deeper problem.


\subsection{Random-walk Reachability}

It has been claimed that many unstructured techniques should work with minor
modification on structured topologies, such as distributed-hash tables.  After
we discovered the rather radical effects of in-degree on reachability,
particularly in out-degree constant topologies, we came to suspect that these
claims may need to be modified.  As such, we have conducted a brief
investigation of reachability on several commonly studied topologies which,
together, represent a cross-section of P2P topologies: Pastry, Gnutella, and
Newscast/Cyclon.

For each topology, we performed a similar transformation as described in
Section \ref{sec:ergodic-application}.  As neither Pastry or Newscast are
deployed widely on the Internet, we used available simulators and extracted
topologies at various points in the run.  While Gnutella is widely deployed,
there are no complete topology dumps available, so instead we used topology
generators based on the measured properties of live networks.  The sources of
our simulations are available in \cite{1,2,3}.  % Need cites

\subsection{Limitations}

Unfortunately, the presented ergodic analysis can only analyze \emph{static}
topologies.  The various results that can be derived from analyzing the
transformation matrix $P$ are only valid for the given temporal topology slice
that $P$ was derived from.  If the topological properties of the graph change,
there is little guarantee that the general results are still valid.

Even if topological properties remain the same, the techniques for controlling
in-degree derived from ergodic analyse may not be valid in a dynamic system.
As nodes gain and lose in-edges, the mixing properties of the network may
change either for the better or the worse.  Further, if the overall in-degree
distribution changes faster than the in-degree control walks can accurately
measure, their use becomes zero.  Protocols such as NewsCast exhibit
such fast changing in-degrees, and other mechanisms would need to be used in
order stabilize in-degree (which may not make sense in the case of NewsCast).

Never the less, even for protocols with fast changing in-degrees, the more
general analysis using $P$ can be useful.  For example, even though the
probability of reaching a node after a properly mixed walk in NewsCast changes
quickly, the distribution of probability of reachability remains almost the
same as the network evolves.  % Would be sweet to show this.
In general, we think these techniques will be useful to the community, but
their applicability will change from protocol to protocol.

\section{Controlling In-degree}

Ergodic markov-models, while useful for analyzing topologies, also suggest
possible solutions to control the standard deviation of the distribution of
in-degree.  We now explore one of these.

A direct result of ergodic mixing analysis is the needed length of a walk, $l$,
before it can be considered random to a given degree.  This leads directly to a
strategy for discovery node in-degree without the need for estimation based on
incoming connections and request.  If a constant rate of walks is launched into
the topology, with a time-to-live of at least $l$, the end point of those walks
can be considered a random sample of the visitation rate of nodes in the
network.  According to the results of the ergodic analysis in Section
\ref{sec:ergodic-analysis}, nodes with higher in-degrees have a higher
probability to be at the end of such a random walk, and therefore should have a
higher rate of visitation.  If the number of such random walks in the network
is high enough, the rate of visitation recorded at nodes in the network should
be closely correlated with the actual in-degree of the node.

In fact, we find this to be the case for Spinneret, as Figure
\ref{fig:indegree-visitation-rate} shows.  Pearson's correlation coefficient
gives the correlation between in-degree and visitation as anywhere between, 

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Degree Constrained Graphs}
Several experiments of interest here.  

\begin{enumeration}
	\item Start with a degree constrained graph,
and for each edge mix it with some other with prob $p$.  This should alternate
between $G_D$ and $G_{rand}$.
	\item Keep all starting vertices of edges in a $G_D$ the same, but change the
end-points.  Start with a grid like topology, where neighbors are connected to
near neighbors, and at each vertex, rewire the end point with probability $p$.
\end{enumeration}

The point with these is to show the unsurprising result that degree distribution
matters.  We should see a sub-class of $G_D$ which is small world.

\subsection{Real topologies}

Look at results of analysis of Gnutella, Cyclon, Pastry, Chord, and Spinneret,
across both mixing degree at different levels of precision and the spread of
reachability probs.

\subsection{Constraining In-degree}

Show that the basic concept of constraining in-degree works by doing so with
Spinneret.  Alternatively, show we can un-bias walks on a biased substrate.
