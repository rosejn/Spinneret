\em Uniform random sampling is an important building block for P2P systems.
Such samples are crucial to both understanding P2P systems, by sampling
properties of nodes, as well as searching them in an unstructured manner, such
as a random walk or epidemic flood.  In this paper we present two main results.
The first is a clear and concise description of how to evaluate the static
performance of sampling via random walks for P2P topologies, using
Markov-models and eigenvalue analysis.  We then introduce the
Metropolis-Hastings method and use it in combination with lessons learned from
Markov-analysis to construct a distributed algorithm that uniformly samples
from any directed P2P topology.  Finally, via a discrete event simulation, we
show that the method works well across a range of directed topologies.
