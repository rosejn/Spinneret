\emph{
Uniform random sampling is an important building block for P2P systems.
Such samples are crucial to both understanding P2P systems, by sampling
properties of nodes, as well as searching them in an unstructured manner, such
as a random walk or epidemic flood.  In this paper we present two main results.
The first is a clear and concise description of how to evaluate the static
performance of sampling with random walks using Markov-models and eigenvalue
analysis.  We then introduce the Metropolis-Hastings method and use it in
combination with lessons learned from Markov-analysis to construct a
distributed algorithm that uniformly samples from any directed P2P topology.
Finally, via discrete event simulation we show that our algorithm works well
across a range of directed topologies.
