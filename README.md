Spinneret

This is a simulation developed as part of a peer-to-peer networking research
project.  You can read all about it in the published paper
[here](http://lifeisagraph.com/publications/hotp2p07.pdf).

Here's the abstract from the paper:

Until now, structured and unstructured networks have
been considered in absentia of each other. We believe that
next-generation P2P services will require both structured
and unstructured algorithms, and that it therefore makes
sense to consider a unified substrate that provides good ser-
vice for both. In this paper we argue for the creation of a
semi-structured overlay substrate, called Spinneret, which
can serve as the base layer for a variety of structured and
unstructured search algorithms. In order to validate that
this structure forms a good foundation for various services,
we present two algorithms simulated on top of the Spinneret
substrate: an unstructured k-walker random walk search as
well as a logarithmic DHT search. Further, we argue that
such a substrate strikes a balance between the resilience
and reliability of unstructured networks and the efficiency
of structured networks.
